Intel program meant to parse and organize intel reported in select chat channels of Eve.

INSTALL/RUN INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install the lastest version of python
2. Run "INSTALL_PYTHON_DEPENDENCIES.bat" (Only required on first run)
3. Log into game fully, past character selection
4. Enter channel name to monitor into "watchlist_channel.txt"
5. Specify system names to monitor in "watchlist_systems.txt", leave alone to monitor any systems mentioned
6. Run "RUN.py" to start program

POSSIBLE BUGS/RESOLUTIONS

1. This program currently supports very little error checking, double check all your settings if experiencing issues
2. Always launch the program after you are logged into the game, new logs are generated every session and if WatchDog is launched first it will grab a old log that is no longer updated

NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS

This program is functional but absolute spaghetti code I really want to redo at one point.
